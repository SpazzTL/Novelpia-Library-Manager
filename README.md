<br>
Useful if you have a large amount of .epub or .txt titled with novel name and want to get each ones novelpia ID. <br>\
Scans a directory and creates a txt file of all books located. IE : 꼬마 중위.epub -> 꼬마 중위 <br>
Then, using the list, goes to novelpia and finds the novel ID, and makes a new list formatted as such : 꼬마 중위, 213626

This is meant to be used with my fork of ([Novelpia Downloader](https://github.com/SpazzTL/NovelpiaDownloader)), or more specifically the output file is meant to be used with the bulk download function to quickly re-download large amount of files.
